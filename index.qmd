Welcome to the **Microbial Innovation Lab (MIL)** at the Department of Chemistry and Environmental Science, **New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT)**. We study how microbes and enzymes transform emerging contaminants, and we develop biotechnology that supports clean water and environmental sustainability.

## Research themes

### Microbial transformation of emerging contaminants
We investigate pathways, intermediates, and rates of biotransformation across environmental and engineered systems, with an emphasis on rigorous analytical confirmation.

### Molecular mechanisms and environmental biocatalysis
We connect genes to function using molecular biology and protein/enzyme characterization, linking mechanism to environmental performance.

### Data-enabled environmental microbiology
We integrate genomics and bioinformatics with high-resolution analytics to understand microbial communities and discover new functions.

## Interested in joining?
We recruit **PhD students and postdoctoral researchers**, and we welcome **international applicants**. Visit the **Join** page for details.
